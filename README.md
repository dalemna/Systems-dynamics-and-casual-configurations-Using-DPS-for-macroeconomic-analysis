## Summary
Dynamic Pattern Synthesis (DPS) provides a novel longitudinal method for evaluating the impacts of macroeconomic and public policy interventions. Rooted in complexity theory and critical realism, DPS combines Cluster Analysis and Configurational Modelling to identify case convergence and divergence while preserving the qualitative uniqueness of each case. 

This paper uses the DPS approach to examine:
- Macroeconomic convergence across Sub-Saharan Africa during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
- The effects of IMF interventions on long-term macroeconomic outcomes.

Key insights include:
- Persistent economic instability across the region.
- Varied responses to external shocks and the importance of 'outliers.'
- Evidence of multiple pathways to achieving policy outcomes, highlighting the complexity of macroeconomic strategies.
